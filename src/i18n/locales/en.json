    "react": "React is a tool that helps build websites like if they were made of reusable building blocks. In this portfolio, it's what makes each section (like skills, contact, or projects) appear and work smoothly.",
    "javascript": "JavaScript is a language that makes websites interactive — like handling buttons, forms, and animations. This site uses it to make things respond when you click or scroll.",
    "nodejs": "Node.js allows using web technologies outside the browser — like running tools on a computer or server. It's not visible on this page, but it's part of the tools used to build and manage the project.",
    "html": "HTML is what gives structure to any webpage — like saying 'this is a title', 'this is an image', etc. Every section you see here is based on this structure, built through React.",
    "css": "CSS makes websites look nice — it defines colors, spacing, and sizes. This portfolio uses a modern style system called Tailwind CSS to control all the visual aspects.",
    "git": "Git is like a time machine for code — it keeps track of changes and helps developers work together. This portfolio uses Git to stay organized and backed up while it's built.",
    "supabase": "Supabase is an online service that stores and sends data for websites. In this portfolio, it can be used to show dynamic content or manage future updates securely.",
    "prisma": "Prisma helps websites talk to databases in a safe and simple way. It's not used directly in this portfolio, but it's a tool I use in other projects with more complex data.",
    "uiux": "UI/UX means how a site looks (UI: user interface) and how it feels to use (UX: user experience). This portfolio was designed to be easy to navigate, readable, and visually pleasant for all visitors."
